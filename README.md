# BotSentry

BotSentry is a lightweight bot-detection tool designed to distinguish between human and automated interactions using machine learning and behavior analysis techniques. The project aims to simulate a basic security system that detects and prevents bot activity based on user interaction patterns and classification models.

## Key Features
- Behavioral Analysis: Detects bot-like patterns in user interactions (e.g., click speed, mouse movement).
- Machine Learning Classification: Utilizes machine learning models to classify traffic as human or bot.
- Device and IP Tracking (Planned): Analyzes IP patterns and device fingerprints to identify suspicious activity.

## Project Goals
1. Implement simple detection mechanisms for identifying bot traffic.
2. Experiment with machine learning models for classifying interactions.
3. Build a prototype security tool to demonstrate bot detection capabilities.

## Installation & Usage
Instructions for setting up the project, dependencies, and running the detection tool will be added as development progresses.
